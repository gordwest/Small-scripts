# Small Scripts

These are some random small scripts I made that come in handy sometimes.

### Scripts
- __printdir__ - Prints the current directory tree
- __currentMouse__ - Prints the current mouse coordinates. Works well when configuring pyautogui scripts
- __capitalGains__ - I use this to calculate the amount of capital gains I need to claim taxes on for the current year. Requires an excel file with trading transactions.
- __stonks.py__ - This script runs every weekday after market close to retrieve my current portfolio value. I used it to track my portfolio performance over time.
